Beta Testing Notes 

- if I press an item first and then the second person also add themselves, my subtotal does not 
change to talk. but the other person sees only half 

- too many floors on total because we dont see the decimals 

- in the form, the items are selected when you go from the currentReceipt because 
they are using the same component (VK)

- add blockers so that if I am not the host, I am unable to edit the receipt (VK)

- loading screen for after taggun and loading my receipts (VK)

- clean up DB (VK)
